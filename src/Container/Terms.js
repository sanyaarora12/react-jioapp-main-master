        . The billing period for Agreement concluded for a definite period of time is the period (number of months), for which the Agreement was concluded. The Provider will issue the invoices with the 14 calendar days due date for the Services provided through web interface or email, unless otherwise stated in the Quotation.

8.2. In case the Agreement is concluded for a definite period of time, before that period expires the Provider will send to the Client the non-binding payment information to pay for the Services for the same period of time. In case the price for the Service is paid in accordance with the payment information, the period of provision of the Service will be automatically extended.

8.3. In case of delay in payment of the price for the Service, the Provider is entitled to receive an interest on late payments in the amount of 0,5 % of outstanding amount for each commenced day of delay. If the Client is in delay with any payment, the Provider is entitled to suspend or limit the provision of the Service until the full payment of the debt. For the period of suspension or limitation of provision of the Service, the Client is still obliged to pay the price in accordance with the delivered tax documents. Repeated delay in payment on the side of the Client is considered as a substantial breach of the Agreement.
